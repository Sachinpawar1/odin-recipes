    <h1 class="h2">Description:</h1>
         <div class="html"><p class="ui">Chicken Biryani is a delicious and aromatic dish that combines tender chicken pieces with fragrant basmati rice, a blend of spices, and fresh herbs. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, this dish is a staple in many households and is often reserved for special occasions due to its rich flavors and intricate preparation. The chicken is marinated in yogurt and spices, then layered with partially cooked rice and cooked to perfection, resulting in a flavorful and hearty meal.</p>
         <p class="ui">This biryani recipe strikes a balance between the spiciness of the masala and the sweetness of the caramelized onions, making it a crowd-pleaser. Serve it with raita (yogurt sauce) and enjoy a feast that tantalizes the taste buds.</p></div>

         <li>2 green cardamom pods</li>
         <li>4 cloves</li>
         <li>3 cinnamon stick</li>
         <li>2 bay leaves</li>
         <li>2 cups water</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil</li>
         <li>Salt to taste</li>
         <li>Saffron strands soaked in 1/4 cup warm milk (optional)</li>
    </ul> 

    <b><h2 class="h2">Steps:</h2></b>
     <ol class="html">
         <li><b>Rinse and soak the rice:</b> Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><b>Marinate the chicken:</b> In a large bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Fry the onions:</b> Heat ghee or oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry until they are golden brown and caramelized. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnish. </li>
        <li><b>Cook the chicken:</b> To the remaining onions in the pot, add minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for a few minutes until fragrant. Add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is no longer pink.</li>
        <li><b>Add tomatoes and spices:</b> Add the chopped tomatoes, biryani masala, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil begins to separate from the mixture.</li>
        <li><b>Prepare the rice:</b> In a separate pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the cumin seeds, green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and bay leaves. Add the soaked and drained rice. Cook until the rice is 70% done, then drain the rice and set aside.</li>
        <li><b>Layer the biryani:</b> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) or prepare a heavy-bottomed pot for stovetop cooking. In the pot with the chicken, spread a layer of partially cooked rice over the chicken. Sprinkle half of the chopped cilantro and mint over the rice. Repeat with another layer of rice and the remaining herbs. Pour the saffron milk over the top layer (if using).</li>
        <li><b>Cook the biryani:</b> Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or cook on the stovetop over low heat for the same amount of time until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.</li>
        <li><b>Garnish and serve:</b> Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Garnish with the reserved fried onions. Serve hot with raita and enjoy your delicious Chicken Biryani!</li>
