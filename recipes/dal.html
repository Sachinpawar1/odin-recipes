    <b><h2 class="h2">Steps:</h2></b>

    <ol class="html">
        <li><b>Rinse and cook the dal:</b> Rinse the toor dal under cold water until the water runs clear. In a large pot, combine the dal, 3 cups of water, turmeric powder, and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the dal is soft and fully cooked, about 30 minutes. Use a spoon to mash some of the cooked dal to thicken the consistency.</li>
        <li><b>Prepare the tempering:</b> In a separate pan, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and mustard seeds, and cook until they begin to splutter. Add the fenugreek seeds and asafoetida, and sauté for a few seconds.</li>
        <li><b>Add aromatics:</b> Add the chopped onion, and sauté until it turns golden brown. Then add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li><b>Cook tomatoes and spices:</b> Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate. Stir in the red chili powder, garam masala, and ground coriander. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Combine and simmer:</b> Pour the tempering mixture into the cooked dal. Mix well and let it simmer for another 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Adjust the salt to taste.</li>
        <li><b>Finish the dish:</b> Stir in the chopped cilantro and lemon juice. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Serve the dal hot, garnished with additional cilantro if desired. Enjoy it with steamed rice, roti, or naan for a complete and satisfying meal.</li>
